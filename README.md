# Project: Rock Paper Scissors
This is the third project of the Fundamentals course of The Odin Project.   
   
The description of the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors).   
   
The webpage created and deployed are [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/).   
   
In this project, a Javascript file is implemented for the interactive rock-paper-scissors game.      
   
I have endeavored to separate the UI and the game logic.   
In addition, I have additionally implemented additional features such as sanitizing the input and making a case where the player can exit the program anytime.   
   
I have also tried to use the best practice for writing git commits, namely the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).   
   
At this stage, the game is solely console-based.   
In the near future, however, I will add more features to the game, including visualization using DOM elements.
